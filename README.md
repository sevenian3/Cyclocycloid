# Cyclocycloid
Skewed drifting epicycloids and hypocycloids

User can draw cyclocycloids - epicycloids and hypocycloids - with arbitrary pen position, 
and allow the circles ("gears") to change size and position throughout the pattern.

User can control line thickness, color gradient, plot style, and number of cycles
to create mathematical art.
